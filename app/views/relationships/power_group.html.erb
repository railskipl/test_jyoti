  <h4> Power Group </h4>

  <strong>"Power Group" is a subset of your Mirrors whose opinions you should take more seriously.</strong> These <br>are people who have wisdom or influence over your happiness and future success.  They could be <br>your supervisors at work, mentors, people you respect, people you love.  To protect their anonymity,<br> <strong>this group's exact size and composition is determined by us.</strong> We use your inputs as well as other<br> factors. <br><br> 


  <strong>You have to define at least 15 relationships (when you give them feedback) to start the process.</strong> <br> The more of your contacts you define your relationship with, the sooner we may be able to present<br> you with your Power Group feedback (tips and ratings just from them).<br><br> 

 

  When available, your <strong>Power Ratings </strong> are viewable on your Reputation Report, and <strong>your Power Tips<br> here.</strong><br><br> 

 

  Whether or not the people important to you have joined Mirror 360 yet, <strong>you can update your<br> relationship below with anyone (after you have given them feedback):</strong> <br><br>
