   <li>Over 70% of employees are not truly engaged </li>
   <li>Employees, managers and leaders are not as self-aware (and hence, productive) as they can be</li>

   <li>Despite assurances, most who give feedback assume that their feedback is not completely anonymous â€“ they feel their employer might be able to identify them</li>
