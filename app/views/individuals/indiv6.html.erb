<h4>Invite to anonymize</h4><br><br>

Before you view your Reputation Report and tips we will take you through a few <br> hands-on steps to make sure there is enough community participation and so you get <br>a feel for how this all works!<br><br><br>




Although there may be tips already waiting for you, we need you to <strong>invite at least 5 <br>people to give you feedback.</strong>  The more you invite, the faster you will see your tips.<br> We need enough feedback to anonymize the tips about you. You can invite them from<br> your social networks or by their emails.<br><br><br>
